# Gesture-Recognizer-App
This app is a simple picture and text change application. The purpose of making this application is to understand the gesture recognizer topic. To do this, first I made the image clickable, then I added the one-touch finger gesture with gesture recognizer. Clicking on the picture will change the picture and text.
