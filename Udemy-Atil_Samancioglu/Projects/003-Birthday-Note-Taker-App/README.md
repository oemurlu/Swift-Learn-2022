# Birthday-Note-Taker-App
This is a basic Birthday Notes app built with User Defaults as the data source. Users can type the name and birthday and save this data in the application. In this way, the last data in the application can be displayed on the screen when the application is opened again after it is terminated. In addition, users can easily delete the data on the label by clicking the delete button. I used label, text field and button to create this app.
