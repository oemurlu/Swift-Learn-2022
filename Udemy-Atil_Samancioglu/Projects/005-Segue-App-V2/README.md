# Segue-App-V2
In this app, I learned how to add screens without a pop-up, move information between screens. When I press the next button in this app, the text I write in the textfield moves to the 2nd screen, but if I switch to the 2nd screen from the go to 2nd viewcontroller button below, the information is not moved.
