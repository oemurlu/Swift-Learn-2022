# Catch-The-Kenny-Game-V2
This is a game where you try to catch Kenny. Kenny moves fast as he disappears and reappears in different parts of the screen, and when you click on him, you earn a point. You have 10 seconds to catch it. Your highest score is saved on the leaderboard and shown to you when you open the game. Also, your score and remaining seconds are shown at the top of the screen while you play. When the time is up, you'll see an alert asking if you want to play. If you choose "No", the game will go to the login screen, if you choose "Yes" the game will start again.
Topics that I reinforced while making this application: I used UserDefaults, gesture recognizer, if statements, arrays, timer and alert method.
