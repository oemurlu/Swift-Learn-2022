# Clima-API
In this application, you can see the live weather conditions of the city you are looking for. In addition, when the application is opened for the first time, it asks the user for location permission, and if the user approves the location permission, the information of the live location is displayed. While looking at the weather conditions of other cities, if desired, the live location weather can be viewed from the upper left button. I learned how to use dark mode, API usage, JSON parsing, live gps data in this application.
